# MarkDiffusion (THU-BPM) — reference

External research backend: [`THU-BPM/MarkDiffusion`](https://github.com/THU-BPM/MarkDiffusion)
(JMLR; Apache-2.0). A **generative watermarking** toolkit for latent diffusion
models — it *embeds* marks, it does not remove them. This repo uses it as a
controlled-experiment harness and as an optional regeneration-removal engine.

## What it covers (image-only scope)

Nine image algorithms in two categories:

| Category | Algorithms | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pattern-based | Tree-Ring, Ring-ID, ROBIN, WIND, SFW | A fixed latent/FT pattern is injected at generation and inverted for detection |
| Key-based | Gaussian-Shading, GaussMarker, PRC, SEAL | A secret key modulates the noise/latent; detection needs the key |

(Video algorithms VideoShield / VideoMark are out of scope for this project.)

## What it gives the remover

- **Same-scheme detector** for the above algorithms via `AutoWatermark.load(...).detect_watermark_in_media()`. Covers the Tree-Ring-class gap in
  `removal-matrix.md`; it does **not** cover StegaStamp, StableSignature, or
  SynthID-media.
- **`DiffusionPurification`** — a blind regeneration attack (DiffPure-style:
  encode → partial noise → reverse-denoise) usable as a pixel-watermark remover.
  Exposed as `--remove-pixel diffusion` in `clean_image.py`.
- **`NeuralCodecCompression`** — codec round-trip (compressai). Not wired here.

## Hard honesty constraints

1. **Detection is same-scheme and same-model only.** Inversion-based detection
   requires the generating model (and for key-based schemes the key). It proves
   "this image came from *this* model/config/params" — it cannot certify that a
   vendor detector will fail on an arbitrary image. This is the same
   same-config-only caveat as the MarkLLM text harness.
2. **`DiffusionPurification` is blind regeneration.** It reuses the *same*
   pipeline, so it will not defeat a watermark that is robust to its own
   regeneration path, and it drifts image content (more than CtrlRegen's
   controllable ControlNet regeneration). Conservative strength default (0.3),
   treated as a fallback/comparison engine, never a guarantee.
3. **Heavy stack.** torch ≥ 2.4,<2.11 + diffusers + a Stable Diffusion model
   download (~4–10 GB). GPU strongly recommended. Some HF models are gated →
   `HF_TOKEN` (env only, never argv).

## License / hygiene

Apache-2.0. Installed from PyPI at a pinned version
(`requirements-markdiffusion.txt`) or an editable checkout at a pinned commit
(`setup_markdiffusion.sh --checkout`). Never bundled into this repo.

## Harness usage

```bash
SCRIPTS=service/scripts
MD="$HOME/markdiffusion/.venv/bin/python"

"$SCRIPTS/setup_markdiffusion.sh"                     # PyPI pin default
# or: "$SCRIPTS/setup_markdiffusion.sh" --checkout    # editable pinned clone

# 1. watermark a test image with a scheme
echo "a red fox in snow" > /tmp/prompt.txt
"$MD" "$SCRIPTS/markdiffusion_harness.py" watermark /tmp/prompt.txt \
  -o /tmp/wm.png -o2 /tmp/plain.png --scheme tr --json

# 2. remove (blind regeneration)
"$MD" "$SCRIPTS/markdiffusion_harness.py" purify /tmp/wm.png \
  -o /tmp/wm.purified.png --purification-strength 0.3 --json

# 3. re-detect with the SAME scheme config
"$MD" "$SCRIPTS/markdiffusion_harness.py" detect /tmp/wm.purified.png \
  --scheme tr --detector-type l1_distance --json
```
