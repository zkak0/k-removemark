Agent skill + stdlib Python service to strip **multi-vendor AI provenance marks** from text and files — for privacy and hygiene on content **you own**. The skill is a thin client: it drives the machinery over HTTP, so the agent host needs no Python.

**Español:** skill de agente + servicio Python (solo stdlib) que elimina marcas
de procedencia AI de texto, código, imágenes, vídeo, audio y metadata. Instálalo
en tu agente con un comando y pide "quita las marcas de agua". 100 % CPU por
defecto, sin modelos, e informe honesto de qué fue verificado frente a
best-effort. Guía no técnica: [`docs/GUIA.md`](docs/GUIA.md).

| Layer | Target | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Invisible Unicode, exotic spaces, bidi, tag chars | Deterministic Python scripts |
| **B** | Statistical (token-sampling) text watermarks | Agent rewrite + optional `rewrite_text.py` hook |
| **Files** | C2PA / EXIF / XMP / doc props | PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, HEIC, BMP, GIF, TIFF, SVG, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, EPUB, ODT, HTML, Markdown, MP4/MOV/M4A/M4V, WAV, MP3 |
| **Visible / DSP** | Gemini sparkle-grid, corner "AI生成" label, tone notches | CPU `image_watermark.py` / `clean_audio.py` (WAV PCM 16-bit) |

Vendors / ecosystems (class-level): **Claude**, **Gemini / SynthID-Text**, **OpenAI** provenance surfaces, **open-LLM** Kirchenbauer-style marks.

**Latest release:** v0.1.0

Skill path: [`skills/remove-ai-marks/`](skills/remove-ai-marks/)  
Service path: [`service/`](service/)

## Install (agent skill)

The skill ships **no code** — it calls the service over HTTP. Install the skill (markdown only) and start the service, then set `WATERMARKS_SERVICE_URL` if it is not `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

### One-line install (any agent)

```bash
# POSIX — detects your agent (opencode, claude-code, cursor, antigravity,
# gemini-cli, copilot, codex) and copies the skills into place:
./install.sh

# Windows (PowerShell):
.\install.ps1
.\install.ps1 -Target cursor   # force a specific agent

# Or via the skills ecosystem (agentskills.io):
npx skills add zkak0/k-removemark
```

### Manual (Grok Build / project-local)

```bash
mkdir -p .grok/skills
ln -sfn "$(pwd)/skills/remove-ai-marks" .grok/skills/remove-ai-marks

mkdir -p ~/.grok/skills
ln -sfn "$(pwd)/skills/remove-ai-marks" ~/.grok/skills/remove-ai-marks
```

Invoke with `/remove-ai-marks` or ask to “strip AI watermarks / C2PA / Claude marks / SynthID-class text.”

### Optional Cursor text-only skill

[`skills/clean-user-facing-text/`](skills/clean-user-facing-text/) is a
self-contained Cursor skill for authorized manuscripts, documentation, and web
copy. It excludes image, C2PA, service, and external-model tooling.

Install it into `~/.cursor/skills/clean-user-facing-text`:

```bash
python3 install_skill.py
```

On Windows, use `py install_skill.py`. The `install-skill.sh` wrapper is
provided for macOS/Linux shells. Existing installations are preserved unless
you pass `--force`; replacement is staged first and the previous install is
kept as a uniquely named backup.

Skill invocation is model-selected. Projects that explicitly adopt this
workflow can also copy the optional rule:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/project/.cursor/rules
cp integrations/cursor/clean-user-facing-text.mdc \
  /path/to/project/.cursor/rules/clean-user-facing-text.mdc
```

For all projects, put the same instruction in Cursor **User Rules** instead.
Rules improve consistency but remain model instructions; Cursor does not expose
a deterministic pre-send filter for final chat responses.

### Start the service

The fastest path is a local HTTP server (Python 3.10+ stdlib only — no deps, no Docker):

```bash
make serve                 # http://127.0.0.1:8765
# or directly:
python3 service/scripts/server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

### Windows (no Docker)

See [docs/windows-autostart.md](docs/windows-autostart.md) for auto-starting the service at Windows login without Docker.

For the whole infra (core + optional harness/heavy backends), see [Docker / compose](#docker--compose) below.

Optional system tools (auto-used when present — preinstalled in the core Docker image):

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`c2patool`](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/tree/main/cli) | Inspect C2PA manifests |
| [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/) | Residual metadata strip (esp. **PDF**) |
| [`qpdf`](https://qpdf.sourceforge.io/) | Structural PDF rebuild — **required** for a real PDF strip (see below) |

Core scripts need **Python 3.10+** stdlib only. Layer B model calls are optional.

## Quick use (scripts)

```bash
SCRIPTS=service/scripts

# Unified inspect / clean
python3 "$SCRIPTS/inspect_file.py" draft.md
python3 "$SCRIPTS/clean_file.py" draft.md -o draft.cleaned.md
python3 "$SCRIPTS/clean_file.py" photo.png -o photo.cleaned.png
python3 "$SCRIPTS/clean_file.py" notes.docx -o notes.cleaned.docx

# Text Layer A
python3 "$SCRIPTS/inspect_text.py" draft.md
python3 "$SCRIPTS/clean_text.py" draft.md -o draft.cleaned.md --stats

# Layer B rewrite hook (default: print prompt only — no model required)
python3 "$SCRIPTS/rewrite_text.py" draft.md --backend print-prompt --strength paraphrase
# Optional local Ollama (loopback only by default — remote endpoints require
# WATERMARKS_REWRITE_ALLOW_REMOTE=1 or --allow-remote):
# WATERMARKS_REWRITE_BACKEND=ollama WATERMARKS_REWRITE_MODEL=llama3.2 \
#   python3 "$SCRIPTS/rewrite_text.py" draft.md -o draft.rewritten.md
# API keys are read from WATERMARKS_REWRITE_API_KEY only (never argv).

# Images
python3 "$SCRIPTS/inspect_image.py" shot.png
python3 "$SCRIPTS/clean_image.py" shot.png -o shot.cleaned.png
```

### Text tools refuse binary input

`inspect_text.py`, `clean_text.py` and `rewrite_text.py` operate on text. Pointed
at a `.docx`, `.pdf` or image they used to decode the compressed bytes and report
whatever codepoints fell out — noise that tracks the compression, not the
content — and `clean_text.py` then wrote those mangled bytes back, destroying the
file. They now refuse binary input and name the tool that handles it:

```bash
python3 "$SCRIPTS/inspect_text.py" report.docx
# refusing to treat report.docx as text: it looks like a ZIP container (DOCX, ODT, …).
# Use inspect_file.py / clean_file.py, which route by format,
# or pass --force-text to scan the raw bytes anyway.
```

Detection is by magic number plus a control-byte ratio, so text in encodings
other than UTF-8 keeps working. `--force-text` overrides it everywhere.

### Unrecognized formats are never auto-cleaned

`classify()` labels bytes that match no supported text, image or container
format as **`unknown`** — it no longer falls back to "text". In auto mode
`clean_file.py` refuses such files (exit 2, no output written) instead of
decoding them as UTF-8 and writing back mangled bytes; `--as text` or
`--force-text` are the explicit opt-ins. `inspect_file.py` reports the file
as `unknown` (exit 0), and the HTTP service answers `/inspect` with
`kind: "unknown"` but rejects `/clean` of unknown formats (400 — send a
filename with a known extension, e.g. `notes.txt`).

## HTTP service

The same machinery runs as a stdlib HTTP service (`service/scripts/server.py`) — the interface the skill uses and the way any web app can integrate without vendoring:

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | — | `{"ok": true, "version": ...}` |
| GET | `/capabilities` | — | optional tools / backends present |
| GET | `/openapi.json` | — | dynamically generated OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec |
| POST | `/inspect` | `{"file": "<base64>", "name": "notes.md"}` | `{"ok", "kind", "suspicious", "report"}` |
| POST | `/detect` | `{"file": "<base64>", "name": "notes.txt"}` | `{"ok", "kind", "detections": [...]}` |
| POST | `/clean` | `{"file": "<base64>", "name": "notes.md", "options": {...}}` | `{"ok", "kind", "cleaned": "<base64>", "report"}` |
| POST | `/inspect/batch` | `{"files": [{"file": "<base64>", "name": "notes.md"}, ...]}` | `{"ok", "results": [{"name", "ok", "kind", "suspicious", "report"}, ...]}` |
| POST | `/clean/batch` | `{"files": [{"file": "<base64>", "name": "notes.md", "options": {...}}, ...]}` | `{"ok", "results": [{"name", "ok", "kind", "cleaned": "<base64>", "report"}, ...]}` |

Batch endpoints loop the same per-file pipeline as `/inspect` and `/clean`, capped at `WATERMARKS_MAX_BATCH_FILES` files per request (default 50). A malformed entry (bad base64, unknown option, unrecognized format) surfaces as that entry's `"ok": false` with an `"error"` string — it never aborts the rest of the batch.

```bash
WM="http://127.0.0.1:8765"
curl -s "$WM/health"                       # {"ok": true, "version": "..."}
curl -s "$WM/openapi.json"                 # machine-readable OpenAPI 3.0.3 contract
curl -s -X POST "$WM/clean" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"file\": \"$(base64 < notes.md | tr -d '\n')\", \"name\": \"notes.md\"}"
```

The service routes by filename extension then magic bytes, so text / image / container are auto-detected. Set `WATERMARKS_SERVER_API_KEY` to require `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on every request. Loopback-only bind by default (`--host` to override); intended for a trusted network.

### Watermark detection (`/detect` and `detect_before` / `detect_after`)

Detection is a separate step from cleaning — the service never calls vendor
APIs unless you ask it to:

- **`POST /detect`** runs the configured watermark detectors on a file.
  Text → vendor detectors + stylometry; image → SynthID pixel score.
- **`/inspect`** accepts an opt-in `"detect": true` flag that appends
  detector results to the text report (and can flip `suspicious`).
- **`/clean`** accepts `"detect_before"` / `"detect_after"` options to
  score the input and the cleaned output, so you can measure what a clean
  actually changed.

Text detectors (see `/capabilities` → `text_detectors`):

| Detector | Activated by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `markllm` | `MARKLLM_DIR` (host checkout) | Research harness (KGW / SynthID schemes), same-config-only — not a vendor oracle. |
| `claude-text` | — (placeholder) | Anthropic has announced a watermark detection API; this seam activates when it ships. |

Image scoring: when `WATERMARKS_SYNTHID_SCORER_URL` is set, the service
scores images through the `wr-synthid-score` sidecar (heavy profile); with a
local `REVERSE_SYNTHID_DIR` it uses the checkout directly. Detection is
fail-soft: unconfigured, timed-out, or errored detectors report
`{"available": false, "error": ...}` and never block cleaning.

## Docker / compose

Published images (GHCR):

| Image tag | Contents | Published? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ghcr.io/zkak0/k-removemark:<tag>` / `:latest` | Core HTTP service + all cleaners + exiftool / qpdf / c2patool | Yes |
| `…:markllm-<tag>` / `:markllm-latest` | MarkLLM text-watermark harness (Apache-2.0 upstream) | Yes |
| `…:markdiffusion-<tag>` / `:markdiffusion-latest` | MarkDiffusion image harness (Apache-2.0 upstream) | Yes |
| `k-removemark-ctrlregen:local` | CtrlRegen pixel removal — **never published** (`noai-watermark` ships no LICENSE) | Local build only |
| `k-removemark-synthid-scorer:local` | reverse-SynthID scorer — **never published** (non-commercial Research License) | Local build only (CLI scorer + optional `wr-synthid-score` HTTP sidecar under the `heavy` profile) |

Build and run the core service:

```bash
make docker-core-build
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8765:8765 --read-only --tmpfs /tmp k-removemark
# any CLI stays runnable by overriding the command:
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/data" k-removemark \
  /app/scripts/clean_file.py /data/notes.md -o /data/notes.cleaned.md
```

Whole-infra bring-up:

```bash
docker compose up -d                         # core HTTP service only
docker compose --profile harness up -d       # + markllm / markdiffusion
docker compose --profile heavy up -d         # + ctrlregen / synthid (local builds)
docker compose --profile harness --profile heavy up -d   # all services
```

The compose stack maps the core service to `127.0.0.1:8765`. The harness/heavy services are one-shot CLIs — invoke with `docker compose run --rm <service> …` when you need verification or pixel work.

Validate the running stack (exit code only, no output on success):

```bash
make compose-check        # or: ./compose-check.sh
```

Checks `wr-core` via `GET /health` and runs each harness/heavy service with `--help`, requiring exit `0`.

### Configuration (env vars for docker compose)

**Nothing is required to clean arbitrary text** — the core service works out of the box:

```bash
echo "Hello\u200bWorld\u00ad!" > /tmp/sample.txt
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/clean -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"file\": \"$(base64 < /tmp/sample.txt | tr -d '\n')\", \"name\": \"sample.txt\"}"
```

Everything else is optional and lives in a `.env` file at the repo root. `docker compose` **auto-loads `.env`** and interpolates the `${VAR}` references in `compose.yaml` from it (shell exports win over `.env` if both are set).

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # then edit
docker compose up -d       # picks up .env automatically
```

`.env` is **gitignored** (deny-by-default) — never commit it. For host-side CLI runs (`rewrite_text.py`, the skill), export the same file into the environment:

```bash
set -a; . ./.env; set +a; python3 service/scripts/rewrite_text.py /tmp/x.txt -o /tmp/x.rewritten.txt
```

| Var | Reaches | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WATERMARKS_SERVER_API_KEY` | `wr-core` (via compose `environment`) | Require `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on the HTTP API |
| `WATERMARKS_GEMINI_*` | — | Removed Aug 2026: Google retired SynthID text watermarking on the API (see `vendor-notes.md`) |
| `WATERMARKS_SYNTHID_SCORER_URL` | `wr-core` | Point core at the `wr-synthid-score` sidecar for SynthID image scoring (e.g. `http://wr-synthid-score:8766` under the heavy profile) |
| `WATERMARKS_SYNTHID_SCORER_API_KEY` | `wr-core` + `wr-synthid-score` | Shared bearer key for the scorer sidecar (empty = no auth) |
| `WATERMARKS_MARKLLM_SCHEME` | `text_detectors.py` (host) | MarkLLM scheme for `/detect`: `kgw` (default) / `synthid` |
| `HF_TOKEN` | harness/heavy services | Hugging Face token for gated models |
| `WATERMARKS_SERVICE_URL` | client only (skill / curl) | Where to reach the service; default `http://127.0.0.1:8765` |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_BACKEND` | `rewrite_text.py` hook | `print-prompt` (default) / `ollama` / `openai-compatible` |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_MODEL` | `rewrite_text.py` hook | Model name (e.g. `deepseek-v4-flash`) |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_BASE_URL` | `rewrite_text.py` hook | API base (e.g. `https://api.deepseek.com`) |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_API_KEY` | `rewrite_text.py` hook | API key — env only, never on argv |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_ALLOW_REMOTE` | `rewrite_text.py` hook | `1` to allow non-loopback endpoints |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_REASONING_EFFORT` | `rewrite_text.py` hook | `none` (default) / `low` / `medium` / `high` / `off` |

Layer B is agent-orchestrated in the skill (it rewrites with its own model), so the `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_*` vars are only needed when driving `rewrite_text.py` directly.

Images publish automatically on `v*` tags via [`.github/workflows/release-images.yml`](.github/workflows/release-images.yml).

## Optional SynthID pixel scoring

`inspect_image.py` and `clean_image.py` can report a pixel-domain SynthID
confidence score when an external checkout of
[`aloshdenny/reverse-SynthID`](https://github.com/aloshdenny/reverse-SynthID)
is available. The scorer is **not bundled**: it is loaded at runtime from your
checkout, and its code remains under the upstream project's non-commercial
Research License.

### Option 1: one-command bootstrap (no Docker)

```bash
SCRIPTS=service/scripts

# Clones upstream, creates a venv, and installs scorer-only dependencies.
"$SCRIPTS/setup_synthid.sh"

# Score an image (default checkout: ~/reverse-SynthID).
REVERSE_SYNTHID_DIR=~/reverse-SynthID \
~/reverse-SynthID/.venv/bin/python "$SCRIPTS/score_synthid.py" shot.png

# Or surface the score from inspect / clean (same venv Python).
REVERSE_SYNTHID_DIR=~/reverse-SynthID \
~/reverse-SynthID/.venv/bin/python "$SCRIPTS/inspect_image.py" shot.png
```

`setup_synthid.sh` accepts `--dir PATH`, `--ref REF`, and `--full` (install the
full upstream `requirements.txt`, which adds `torch`/`diffusers` for the
upstream VAE bypass this project does not use).

On Windows use `setup_synthid.ps1` (`-Dir`, `-Ref`, `-Full`), which creates the
venv at `.venv\Scripts\` — the layout `image_meta.py` already looks for on
`os.name == "nt"`.

### Option 2: local Docker build

```bash
make docker-synthid-build
# Run unprivileged and with a read-only rootfs; the scorer only needs to read
# /data and write to stdout/tmp.
docker run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --read-only --tmpfs /tmp \
  -v "$(pwd):/data" \
  k-removemark-synthid-scorer /data/shot.png
```

The image is built locally from the upstream source at build time. It is not
published, so it does not redistribute the upstream code.

### Option 3: HTTP scorer sidecar (docker compose)

Under the `heavy` profile the compose stack also runs the scorer as an HTTP
sidecar (`wr-synthid-score`) so the **published core service** can score
images before/after cleaning without bundling the non-commercial upstream
code. Point `wr-core` at it and share a bearer key (see `.env.example`):

```bash
# .env
WATERMARKS_SYNTHID_SCORER_URL=http://wr-synthid-score:8766
WATERMARKS_SYNTHID_SCORER_API_KEY=change-me

docker compose --profile heavy up -d
```

Then `POST /clean` with `{"options": {"detect_before": true,
"detect_after": true}}` returns `synthid_before` / `synthid_after` in the
report, and `POST /detect` on an image returns the SynthID score. Fail-soft:
if the sidecar is down or unconfigured, reports carry
`{"available": false, "error": ...}` and cleaning still succeeds.

V4 scoring uses `artifacts/spectral_codebook_v4.npz` from the upstream checkout
(`220 MB). This is **detection/scoring only** — it does not remove pixel
watermarks.

## Optional CtrlRegen pixel removal

For **pixel-domain** image watermarks (SynthID-class, StegaStamp, Tree-Ring,
StableSignature), an optional external backend runs the CtrlRegen pipeline
(ControlNet + DINOv2 IP-Adapter controllable regeneration). The backend is
[`mertizci/noai-watermark`](https://github.com/mertizci/noai-watermark), a
maintained reimplementation of the ICLR 2025
[CtrlRegen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05470) method with automatic tiling.

The backend is **not bundled** and ships no LICENSE file, so it is treated as
all-rights-reserved: it is cloned at a pinned commit and loaded at runtime.
Its research-era dependency pins (`requirements-ctrlregen.txt` — e.g.
`transformers==4.37.2`, `diffusers==0.27.2`) carry published advisories and
are intentionally not current, so they are only ever installed inside the
dedicated venv this script creates and never into the main service image;
`setup_ctrlregen.sh` also re-verifies the pinned commit on existing
checkouts, not just fresh clones.

### Bootstrap

```bash
SCRIPTS=service/scripts

# Clones upstream (pinned commit), creates a venv, installs torch + deps.
"$SCRIPTS/setup_ctrlregen.sh"

# Standalone removal (default checkout: ~/noai-watermark).
NOAI_WATERMARK_DIR=~/noai-watermark \
~/noai-watermark/.venv/bin/python "$SCRIPTS/clean_ctrlregen.py" shot.png -o shot.ctrlregen.png
```

On Windows use `setup_ctrlregen.ps1` (same flags as `-Dir`, `-Ref`, `-Python`);
the venv lands in `.venv\Scripts\`, which `clean_image.py` already resolves.
It probes the published PyTorch wheel indices and picks the highest one at or
below the CUDA version `nvidia-smi` prints that actually exists — that number
is the maximum the *driver* supports, and drivers are backward compatible, so a
driver reporting 13.1 (no published `cu131`) installs `cu130`. Below compute
capability 7.5 it forces `cu126`, the last index whose wheels still carry
Maxwell/Pascal/Volta kernels. It installs `torch` **and** `torchvision`
together from that index so the dependency install cannot swap them for CPU
builds from PyPI, then verifies after install that `torch.cuda.is_available()`
is true — if a GPU was detected but torch ends up CPU-only, the script warns
loudly and exits non-zero instead of pretending the setup succeeded.

### From `clean_image.py`

```bash
NOAI_WATERMARK_DIR=~/noai-watermark \
~/noai-watermark/.venv/bin/python "$SCRIPTS/clean_image.py" shot.png \
  -o shot.cleaned.png --remove-pixel ctrlregen
```

Order of operations: metadata strip first, then CtrlRegen pixel removal, then
an optional reverse-SynthID before/after score (when `REVERSE_SYNTHID_DIR` is
also set).

**Strength is conservative by default** (`--ctrlregen-strength 0.25`), because
higher strength removes more watermark but regenerates more of the image.
Documented presets: `0.15` minimal / `0.25` default / `0.35` balanced /
`0.5` aggressive / `0.7` max (backend default is 0.5). `--ctrlregen-steps`
defaults to 50 (effective denoising steps ≈ steps × strength).

### Image size (512×512 native limit)

CtrlRegen is a 512×512 Stable Diffusion 1.5 ControlNet. The backend resolves
this for arbitrary inputs, so no extra tiling is exposed here:

- **≤512 px:** single pass — center-crop/resize to 512, regenerate, resize back.
- **>512 px:** automatic overlapping tiling (512 px tiles, 192 px overlap),
  width/height aligned to multiples of 8, then cosine-blended seams.
- **Either path:** output is resized to the original size and color-matched to
  the original image.

Very large images (e.g. 4K) produce many tiles, so runs scale with tile count
(slower and higher VRAM). Pre-downscale large inputs when practical; tile size
and overlap are hardcoded upstream and are not exposed as flags.

### Compute, gated models, and verification

Expect ~10 GB of model downloads; a GPU is strongly recommended and CPU runs
are slow. Some upstream models are gated, so export `HF_TOKEN` (env only —
never argv). `clean_ctrlregen.py` refuses to auto-install dependencies; run
`setup_ctrlregen.sh` first.

There is no local detector for StegaStamp/Tree-Ring/StableSignature, so the
only local signal is the reverse-SynthID score (a surrogate). When available,
`clean_image.py --remove-pixel ctrlregen` reports that score before/after; the
official Google SynthID check remains the final authority.

### Docker

```bash
make docker-ctrlregen-build
docker run --rm -e HF_TOKEN="$HF_TOKEN" \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v "$(pwd):/data" \
  k-removemark-ctrlregen /data/shot.png -o /data/shot.ctrlregen.png
```

## Optional MarkLLM text-watermark verification

For **controlled experiments**, an optional external harness wraps
[`THU-BPM/MarkLLM`](https://github.com/THU-BPM/MarkLLM) (Apache-2.0) to
watermark test text and re-detect it after a Layer B rewrite — e.g. prove that
a KGW (Kirchenbauer, your "open-LLM" row) or SynthID-Text (Gemini row) mark
disappears under your rewrite. It is a **verification harness, not an oracle**:
MarkLLM detection is only valid against the *same* scheme config + keys used at
generation, and it cannot certify a vendor detector will fail.

The backend is **not bundled**. `setup_markllm.sh` clones upstream at a pinned
commit, creates a venv, and installs pinned deps (torch + transformers); the
scoring model (default `facebook/opt-1.3b`, Apache-2.0) downloads from Hugging
Face on first run.

```bash
SCRIPTS=service/scripts

# Bootstrap (clones upstream, creates ~/MarkLLM/.venv, installs deps).
"$SCRIPTS/setup_markllm.sh"

# Generate watermarked + unwatermarked sample text under the KGW scheme.
MARKLLM_DIR=~/MarkLLM \
  ~/MarkLLM/.venv/bin/python "$SCRIPTS/detect_text_watermark.py" watermark prompt.txt \
    --scheme kgw -o wm.txt -o2 plain.txt

# Detect the scheme mark in a text file.
MARKLLM_DIR=~/MarkLLM \
  ~/MarkLLM/.venv/bin/python "$SCRIPTS/detect_text_watermark.py" detect wm.txt --scheme kgw --json
```

**Verification around a Layer B rewrite:** pass `--markllm-scheme` to
`rewrite_text.py` (with `--markllm-dir`), and it records the MarkLLM detection
before/after plus a `cleared` flag:

```bash
export WATERMARKS_REWRITE_BACKEND=ollama WATERMARKS_REWRITE_MODEL=llama3.2
MARKLLM_DIR=~/MarkLLM \
  python3 "$SCRIPTS/rewrite_text.py" wm.txt -o wm.rewritten.txt \
    --markllm-scheme kgw --markllm-dir "$HOME/MarkLLM" --json-stats
```

**Detection-guided iterative rewriting:** Layer B now rewrites iteratively and
stops as soon as an attempt passes evaluation. Each evaluation round generates
`--candidates` variants (default **1**, `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_CANDIDATES`)
and `--max-loops` caps how many rounds run before the best-effort variant is
returned (default **1**, `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_LOOPS`). Each variant is one
rewrite call plus one evaluation, and a round exits early on the first attempt
the evaluator reports as not watermarked — so raising `--max-loops` retries
new variants until an evaluation passes (a typical clean rewrite costs one
attempt). The evaluator is chosen by priority:

1. **MarkLLM** — same-config research detection, when `--markllm-scheme` is
   passed (with `--markllm-dir`). A vendor-detector slot is reserved above
   MarkLLM for Google's SynthID-text detector, which Google retired on its API
   in Aug 2026 — a future vendor endpoint can plug in there.
2. **bigram-Jaccard lexical divergence** — when no detector is configured; no
   pass/fail verdict, so every attempt is generated and the most lexically
   diverged one is selected (the original behavior).

`--json-stats` reports the evaluator, attempts made, pass/fail, and per-attempt
records:

```json
{
  "evaluator": "markllm",
  "candidates": 1,
  "max_loops": 2,
  "attempts_made": 2,
  "passed": true,
  "candidate_scores": [
    {
      "lexical_divergence": 0.91,
      "selection_score": 0.91,
      "selected": false,
      "passed": false,
      "evaluation": {"detector": "markllm", "available": true, "scheme": "kgw",
                     "is_watermarked": true, "score": 4.3, "threshold": 3.0}
    },
    {
      "lexical_divergence": 0.84,
      "selection_score": 0.84,
      "selected": true,
      "passed": true,
      "evaluation": {"detector": "markllm", "available": true, "scheme": "kgw",
                     "is_watermarked": false, "score": 1.7, "threshold": 3.0}
    }
  ],
  "markllm": {"scheme": "kgw", "before": {"...": "..."}, "after": {"...": "..."},
              "cleared": true, "note": "same-config only"}
}
```

A detector that is unconfigured, times out, or errors yields an
`"available": false` entry with an `error` reason and never fails the
rewrite — that attempt simply cannot pass, and the loop falls back to
lexical-divergence selection. When the max is exhausted without a pass, the
least-watermarked (lowest score) attempt is returned as best-effort with a
note.

If the backend is unconfigured or its deps are missing, the rewrite proceeds
and the report notes verification was unavailable. A GPU is recommended; CPU
runs work but are slow, and the model download is a few GB.

Hardening knobs:

- `--offline` on the adapter (or any MarkLLM run) loads the scoring model from
  the Hugging Face cache only — zero network egress; fails fast if not cached.
  Custom remote code is never executed (transformers `trust_remote_code` is
  never enabled).
- `WATERMARKS_MARKLLM_RLIMIT_AS=<bytes>` (env, POSIX) applies an address-space
  limit to the MarkLLM detector subprocess. Off by default because torch/CUDA
  usually needs large address spaces.
- Config files are capped at 1 MiB; the upstream checkout and the base image
  are pinned by SHA/digest.

### Docker

```bash
make docker-markllm-build
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$(pwd):/data" \
  k-removemark-markllm detect /data/wm.txt --scheme kgw --json
```

## Optional SynthID-text removal benchmark

[`bench_synthid_text.py`](service/scripts/bench_synthid_text.py) measures how
effectively a Layer B rewrite clears SynthID-text-class watermarks and at
what cost. It generates watermarked + unwatermarked samples with the MarkLLM
SynthID scheme (same-config detection, sanity-gated), runs your rewrite
variants (strength × max rewrite attempts; the loop stops early on pass) plus
controls (no-removal, Layer-A-only, optional re-stamp check), and writes a
shareable `report.md` /
`results.json` / `results.csv`. Full guide:
[`docs/synthid-text-benchmark.md`](docs/synthid-text-benchmark.md).

Requires a MarkLLM checkout (`setup_markllm.sh` / `MARKLLM_DIR`) and a
rewrite backend. **The rewriting model is an LLM you configure** — the same
`rewrite_text.py` backend the skill uses. MarkLLM's default
`facebook/opt-1.3b` (`--markllm-model`) is only the watermark
generator/detector; it never rewrites. Configure the rewrite model via env
vars or benchmark flags (they mirror the
[config table](#configuration-env-vars-for-docker-compose) above):

| Env var | Benchmark flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_BACKEND` | `--rewrite-backend` | `ollama` | `ollama` or `openai-compatible` |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_MODEL` | `--rewrite-model` | *(required)* | The LLM that performs the rewrite (e.g. `llama3.2`, `deepseek-v4-flash`) |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_BASE_URL` | `--rewrite-base-url` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` | Endpoint; the Ollama default is loopback |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_API_KEY` | `--rewrite-api-key` | — | API key (env-only in the child process, never argv) |
| `WATERMARKS_REWRITE_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` | `--rewrite-allow-remote` | off | Required to send content to non-loopback endpoints |

```bash
# Ollama (loopback):
python3 service/scripts/bench_synthid_text.py --markllm-dir ~/MarkLLM \
  --rewrite-backend ollama --rewrite-model llama3.2

# OpenAI-compatible API (remote):
WATERMARKS_REWRITE_API_KEY=... python3 service/scripts/bench_synthid_text.py \
  --markllm-dir ~/MarkLLM --rewrite-backend openai-compatible \
  --rewrite-model deepseek-v4-flash --rewrite-base-url https://api.deepseek.com \
  --rewrite-allow-remote
```

Use a **non-origin model** for rewriting (do not rewrite with the same
watermarked model that generated the text) or the rewrite can re-stamp the
output; `--restamp-control` measures this.

## Optional MarkDiffusion image-watermark harness

For **controlled experiments on images**, an optional external harness wraps
[`THU-BPM/MarkDiffusion`](https://github.com/THU-BPM/MarkDiffusion) (Apache-2.0),
a *generative watermarking* toolkit for latent diffusion models (it embeds marks
— it does not remove them). We use it for three things:

1. **Verification harness** (like MarkLLM, but for images): watermark a test
   image with a scheme, run removal, and re-detect with the *same* scheme config
   — e.g. prove a Tree-Ring-class mark clears under your pipeline. It is a
   **verification harness, not an oracle**: detection requires the generating
   model (and keys for key-based schemes), so it cannot certify a vendor
   detector will fail on an arbitrary image.
2. **Optional pixel-removal engine**: its `DiffusionPurification` regeneration
   attack is exposed as `clean_image.py --remove-pixel diffusion`, an
   alternative to CtrlRegen. It is **blind** regeneration (no ControlNet
   conditioning), so it drifts image content more than CtrlRegen — conservative
   strength default (`0.3`), treated as a fallback/comparison, never a
   guarantee.
3. **Local same-scheme detector** for Tree-Ring-class marks, partially filling
   the "no local detector for StegaStamp/Tree-Ring/StableSignature" gap (it
   covers Tree-Ring/Ring-ID/Gaussian-Shading etc., not StegaStamp /
   StableSignature / SynthID-media).

The backend is **not bundled**. `setup_markdiffusion.sh` creates a venv and
installs `markdiffusion==1.0.2` from PyPI (pinned), with torch installed from
the right platform index; `--checkout` installs an editable clone at a pinned
commit instead. The Stable Diffusion model (default
`huanzi05/stable-diffusion-2-1-base`) downloads from Hugging Face on first run.

```bash
SCRIPTS=service/scripts

# Bootstrap (PyPI pin default; creates ~/markdiffusion/.venv, installs deps).
"$SCRIPTS/setup_markdiffusion.sh"

# 1. Generate a Tree-Ring watermarked image (+ unwatermarked control).
echo "a red fox in snow" > /tmp/prompt.txt
MARKDIFFUSION_DIR=~/markdiffusion \
  ~/markdiffusion/.venv/bin/python "$SCRIPTS/markdiffusion_harness.py" watermark \
    /tmp/prompt.txt -o wm.png -o2 plain.png --scheme tr --json

# 2. Remove with the DiffusionPurification regeneration attack.
MARKDIFFUSION_DIR=~/markdiffusion \
  ~/markdiffusion/.venv/bin/python "$SCRIPTS/markdiffusion_harness.py" purify \
    wm.png -o wm.purified.png --purification-strength 0.3 --json

# 3. Re-detect with the SAME scheme config.
MARKDIFFUSION_DIR=~/markdiffusion \
  ~/markdiffusion/.venv/bin/python "$SCRIPTS/markdiffusion_harness.py" detect \
    wm.purified.png --scheme tr --detector-type l1_distance --json
```

Or run purification as part of the normal image pipeline:

```bash
MARKDIFFUSION_DIR=~/markdiffusion \
  ~/markdiffusion/.venv/bin/python "$SCRIPTS/clean_image.py" shot.png \
    -o shot.cleaned.png --remove-pixel diffusion
```

Hardening knobs mirror the MarkLLM harness: `--offline` loads the model from
the Hugging Face cache only (zero network egress, no remote code), `HF_TOKEN`
is env-only (never argv), algorithm configs are capped at 1 MiB, and the
subprocess gets the same higher resource caps as CtrlRegen.

### Docker

```bash
make docker-markdiffusion-build
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$(pwd):/data" \
  k-removemark-markdiffusion detect /data/wm.png --scheme tr --json
```

The image installs a CPU torch; CUDA users should run `setup_markdiffusion.sh`
on the host instead. Model downloads still hit the HF hub on first run.

## How text marking works (short)

Modern LLM watermarks often hide a signal in **which tokens are chosen** (generative / sampling bias), not only in invisible characters. Edit-based schemes inject Unicode or synonym rules. File schemes attach **C2PA** or generator metadata.

- **Layer A** removes edit-based Unicode carriers (testable).
- **Layer B** attacks sampling watermarks via heavy rewrite (best-effort; literature-standard attacks such as paraphrase / back-translation).
- **File cleaners** strip C2PA/XMP/props from supported containers.

Until vendors ship public detectors and keys, **no tool can honestly certify** “this fails the official check.” Reports must separate verifiable vs best-effort work.

Prefer a **non-origin** model for Layer B (do not rewrite Claude text with Claude if you are trying to avoid re-stamping).

---

## Disclaimer: what removing a text watermark costs

Text watermarks live in **the wording itself**: the signal is spread across token choices, so nearly every sentence carries a little of it. Two consequences follow, and they are why Layer B is honestly described as *best-effort* rather than a magic eraser.

1. **Removal means rewording, not restructuring.** Shuffling paragraphs, changing headings, or light touch-ups barely move the signal. Stripping a statistical mark requires rewriting a substantial fraction of the text — sentence by sentence, not section by section.

2. **Rewording degrades the copy.** Any rewrite replaces the original word choices with the rewriting model's, which flattens tone, voice, and precision. On production copy (SEO, marketing, client work) that degradation is real and often visible to the people who care most about the writing. It is like taking text from a top-tier model and asking a less capable model to rewrite it from scratch: the result cannot exceed the rewrite model's ceiling.

Which leads to the honest full-circle question:

> If the plan is to rewrite the text with a cheaper model anyway, why pay for a premium model in the first place? Generating directly with the cheaper model is simpler, cheaper, and produces the same — or better — end result.

Layer B makes sense when you specifically want the premium model's **thinking and drafting** and accept a rewrite pass to satisfy a hygiene or privacy requirement — not as a cheap route to mark-free text.

**When to skip Layer B:**

- **Quality matters more than hygiene:** use the lossless path — Layer A Unicode scrub plus the file metadata cleaners — and keep the original prose.
- **Rewriting anyway:** use a **non-origin** model (rewriting with the origin model can re-stamp the text), and remember residual risk remains — no tool can certify a vendor detector will fail.

## File formats

| Format | Inspect | Clean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PNG / JPEG / WebP | C2PA chunks / APP11 / RIFF `C2PA`, AI XMP hints | Drop metadata segments |
| AVIF / HEIC | ISOBMFF `jumb` / XMP `uuid` boxes | Drop boxes |
| BMP | Trailing non-image bytes (no standardized channel) | Truncate trailing metadata, fix file-size field |
| GIF | Comment / XMP application extensions | Drop comment & XMP, keep `NETSCAPE2.0` loop |
| TIFF (classic + BigTIFF) | IFD tags: XMP, EXIF, GPS, IPTC, MakerNote | Drop tags, zero payloads, keep strips |
| SVG | `<metadata>`, XMP | Strip blocks |
| PDF | Byte/XMP + optional tools | **exiftool** then **qpdf**; degraded without either |
| DOCX | docProps / customXml | Scrub props, drop customXml |
| EPUB | OPF metadata, XHTML meta/JSON-LD, embedded media | Scrub OPF, strip XHTML meta, clean media + Layer A (skips encrypted parts) |
| ODT | meta.xml | Drop generator / AI-ish meta |
| HTML | meta, JSON-LD, data-ai* | Strip tags/attrs |
| Markdown | YAML frontmatter AI keys | Drop keys + Layer A body |
| MP4 / MOV / M4A / M4V | ISOBMFF `jumb`/`uuid` boxes (same mechanism as AVIF/HEIC) + `moov/udta` generator tags | Drop boxes |
| WAV | RIFF `LIST INFO` chunk, embedded `id3 ` chunk | Drop chunks |
| MP3 | ID3v2 frames (v2.3/v2.4 per-frame; v2.2 whole-tag) | Drop matched frames or whole tag |

#### Why PDF needs qpdf, not just exiftool

ExifTool writes PDFs **incrementally**. `exiftool -all=` appends a
`%BeginExifToolUpdate` block that frees the Info object and drops `/Info` from
the trailer — but the original metadata bytes stay in the file verbatim, and
exiftool itself can undo the edit with `-PDF-update:all=`. The command exits
`0`, viewers show no metadata, and the file gets *larger*, which is the tell.

For a provenance-stripping tool that is a silent leak, so `clean_pdf` follows
the exiftool pass with `qpdf --linearize`, which re-serializes the document
from its object graph and drops the now-unreferenced objects. Without `qpdf`
installed the clean still runs, but it says so:

```
warning: exiftool PDF edits are incremental — the original metadata bytes
remain recoverable; install qpdf for a structural rewrite
```

Pixel-domain watermark **removal** is now available as an optional external CtrlRegen backend (see above); it is a regenerating remover, not a guarantee. **C2PA soft binding** (in-content watermark that can re-link a remote Content Credentials manifest after metadata is stripped) remains **out of scope**. Stripping hard-bound C2PA does **not** clear those channels.

### Residual risk after a clean

This tool reports **verifiable** removals (Unicode counts, metadata actions) and **best-effort** Layer B rewrites. It cannot certify that vendor detectors will fail.

To check residual signals yourself (optional, external):

| Channel | What we remove | What may remain | External check (examples) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hard-bound C2PA / EXIF / XMP | Yes | Soft-bound / pixel marks | [c2patool](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/tree/main/cli), [Content Credentials verify](https://contentcredentials.org/verify) |
| SynthID-class media | Optional pixel removal (external CtrlRegen); local score otherwise | Audio/video watermark; residual pixel watermark after removal | Provider tools (e.g. [Google SynthID](https://deepmind.google/science/synthid/) / Vertex detector where offered); optional local [reverse-SynthID](https://github.com/aloshdenny/reverse-SynthID) scorer |
| Statistical text | Best-effort rewrite | Strong marks after light edit | No public universal detector; vendor tools when available |

## Pre-commit hook

CI gating already exists (`audit_dir.py`'s SARIF export, see [Coverage matrix](#coverage-matrix) context) — the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks below catch the same class of problem earlier, before a marked file is even committed. Both wrap the existing CLIs (`audit_dir.py` / `clean_file.py`) — no separate detection logic.

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/zkak0/k-removemark
    rev: v0.1.0   # pin to a tag/commit
    hooks:
      - id: k-removemark-check   # fails the commit if marks are found
      # - id: k-removemark-clean # opt-in: cleans staged files in place instead
```

`k-removemark-check` fails the commit and lists findings; `k-removemark-clean` is opt-in and rewrites staged files in place (exits non-zero so you review the diff and re-stage — the same convention as auto-fixing hooks like `ruff --fix`). Run either by hand with `python3 service/scripts/check_staged.py <files...>` / `clean_staged.py <files...>`.
